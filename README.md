# Ants-vs.-Bees
This project was created in conjunction with UC Berkeley's CS W61A class offering. 

# Your Goal 
You must defend the colony against the onslaught of bees. They are swarming the colony and it must be protected at all costs. 

# About 
A very similar game to plants vs. zombies, but with some tweaks. It is now the fight between Ants and the Bees. Most functions are replicated either in part or whole to plants vs. zombies. 

# Notes
This repository should allow for the game to be played in whole. All components have been added.
